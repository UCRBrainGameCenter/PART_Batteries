Three of the sounds will be \"ordinary\" and one will be \"special\".  The \"special\" sound that you need to identify will always be one of the two in the middle.  The first sound and the last sound will be examples of the \"ordinary\" sound.\n\nIn the following quick example, the \"ordinary\" sound just is silence and the \"special\" sound is not.  After listening to all four sounds, tap on the square the \"special\" sound came from."
