When it appears, it will be accompanied by an auditory stimulus.\n\nEach block will begin with a Blue-colored Standard stimulus that should be swiped to the Left (towards the Blue border).  It will be followed by a Green-colored Target stimulus, that should be swiped to the Right (towards the Green border).\n\nThe first two special stimuli of each block will be followed by 10 Silver-Colored stimuli. Swipe them Left if they match the Standard, swipe them Right if they match the Target.\n\nAfter every 10 trials, the collective results will be submitted to the algorithm as a single  CorrectResponse if there were 8+ correct TAS responses (it's a parameter).  Thus, the algorithm was configured to just be a 1\/1 staircase."
