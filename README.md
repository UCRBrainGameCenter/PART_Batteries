# PART Batteries

_A collection of batteries and assessments for use in the audiological assessment application PART_

## Assessments

### STM Detection Threshold

**Purpose:** Determines the stimulus level at which the subject can identify the presence of the stimulus, in quiet.  Used to calibrate STM Sensitivity.

**Adaptivity:** Adapts on stimulus level.

**Variants:** Isolated presentation to each ear.

### STM Sensitivity

**Purpose:** Determines the theshold at which the subject can identify the presence of spectrotemporal envelope modulation of noise.

**Adaptivity:** Adapts on modulation depth.

**Variants:** Isolated presentation to each ear.

## Batteries

### STM With Threshold Detection

**Process:** Runs the STM Detection Threshold for each ear to determine proper presentation level.  Then runs the STM sensitivity task on each ear at the detection level + 30dB.

**Outputs:** Modulation detection depth thresholds for each ear.

### STM With Threshold Input

**Process:** Experimenter can manually input a detection threshold to use for the STM stimulus for the Left and Right ears.  Then runs the STM sensitivity task on each ear at the detection level + 30dB.

**Outputs:** Modulation detection depth thresholds for each ear.
