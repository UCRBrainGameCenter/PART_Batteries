Three of the sounds will be \"ordinary\" and one will be \"special\".  The \"special\" sound that you need to identify will always be one of the two in the middle.  The first sound and the last sound will be examples of the \"ordinary\" sound.\n\nIn the following quick example, the \"ordinary\" sound just is silence and the \"special\" sound is not.  After listening to all four sounds, tap on the square the \"special\" sound came from."

The wobbling sound will be one of the center two boxes.\n\nCan you identify the wobbling sound? \n\nThe program will try to find the smallest wobble that you can hear. That means that sometimes it will appear that none of the sounds were wobbly. In that case the difference was too small for you to notice it, so just press either of the middle two boxes. When the program finds that smallest wobble you can notice, it will proceed to the next phase."
